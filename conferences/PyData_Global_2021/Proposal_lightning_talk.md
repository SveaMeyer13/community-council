Proposal Lightning Talk


Introducing sktime, a unified interface for machine learning with time series data. Developing advanced time series analysis capabilities for researchers and practitioners is one of the major challenges of contemporary machine learning. sktime is a new unified Python toolbox and our ambition is to provide for time series what scikit-learn provides for tabular data. In our lightning talk you will learn about the various time series learning problems covered by sktime, which are forecasting, classification/regression, annotation and clustering.
